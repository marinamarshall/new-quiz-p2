## About The Website

## User Experience (UX)

### The Strategy Plane

Build an online quiz that is a fun game/challenge. Audience ranges from 20-40 year olds, any younger or older would create too much of an age gap. 

### The Scope Plane

Multiple choice question, possibly could add a timer feature, correct answers earn the most points, 6 categories of questions to give the user choice. General knowledge-based

### The Structure Plane

One simple page that a user can select one question category (from a choice of 6) and then questions from that category will be asked in a MCQ style. The quiz will be a one page website. Features include a submit button and a score tally.  

### The Skeleton Plane

Images on input/button elements for visual appeal and to guide the user as to what the category is without reading the label. The text element on the categories also benefits visually impaired users. Questions will feature text/images.

### The Surface Plane
Neutral colours, intuitive layout, images based on categories selected
